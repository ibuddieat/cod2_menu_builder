1. Dsiplay text might be bigger then the actual one in game. To avoid this dont use autoScaleRect in settings. (programming language barier).

2. Elements are only displayed in 4:3 AR. Keep rectangular value to x x x x 4 4 to make it streach on different sceen sizes (its set by default).

3. Alpha value does not display with some elements (programming language barier).

4. Had some trouble with macro implementation so i decided to leave it out.
